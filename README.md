# Concrete Strength Predictive Modeling

## Description
This project compares three regression approaches of increasing complexity for predicting concrete compressive strength from eight material components: 
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
- Random Forest

## Dataset
The dataset used was obtained from: Yeh, I. (1998). Concrete Compressive Strength [Dataset]. UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Results
- Linear Regression provides a reasonable baseline, but fails to capture the true structure and nonlinearity in the data.
- The GAM achieves a good balance between predictive performance and interpretability, making it a strong middle-ground approach.
- Finally, the Random Forest, being more flexible and capable of modeling complex relationships, delivers the best overall predictive performance for this problem.

## Tools 
- R ((statistical modeling and visualization)
- Quarto
